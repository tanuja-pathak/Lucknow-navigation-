# Lucknow-navigation-
This is a simple Python program that will take information of the source and the destination of Lucknow and display the fare and shortest path and the shortest distance to reach the destination. It will help the user for better navigation.


The idea is implemented using Graph data structures.The graph has nodes and edges.Nodes represent a name of different places in lucknow and the edges represent the distance(in Km) and the cost between the two places.


By using Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path and shortest distance and the minimum cost between the source and the destination is determined.
Finally, the shortest route,shortest distance and the minimum cost will be displayed.



The intution is to find the minimum possible distance and the minimum possible cost which every user wants so that user can reach to the destination in minimum possible cost in shorter time(which can be found by taking the shorter path distance and user also has to give minimum price)


shortest_path_with_mincost_mindistance contains all the major code implementation.
